						<h3>Withdrawal of consent</h3>
						<p>Accredited investors are assumed to be better informed, and better able to access resources to protect their own interests, and therefore require less regulatory protection. Investors who agree to be treated as accredited investors therefore forgo the benefit of certain regulatory safeguards.</p> 

						<p>For example, issuers of securities are exempted from issuing a full prospectus registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore in respect of offers that are made only to accredited investors, and intermediaries are exempted from a number of business conduct requirements when dealing with accredited investors. Investors should consult a professional adviser if they do not understand any consequence of being treated as an accredited investor. If you have consented to be treated as an accredited investor in respect of your access and use of the SAC Mobile App, you may at any time notify SAC Capital that you no longer wish to be treated as such at <a href="mailto:enquiry@saccapital.com.sg" style="color:#ff814e;">enquiry@saccapital.com.sg</a>. SAC Capital shall no longer treat you as an accredited investor after 7 Business Days from such notification.</p>
