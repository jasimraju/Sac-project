						<h3>Consent for Accredited Investor</h3>
						<p>Only accredited or institutional investors may use our platform, and this is because such investors are better able in terms of financial and other resources to seek their own professional advice and conduct the necessary due diligence prior to making any investment decision. You should seek independent professional advice if you do not fully understand the risks of investing through our platform. Investors will also not have access to the dispute resolution scheme operated by the Financial Industry Disputes Resolution Centre Ltd.</p> 

						<p>Accredited investors are assumed to be better informed, and better able to access resources to protect their own interests, and therefore require less regulatory protection. Investors who agree to be treated as accredited investors therefore forgo the benefit of certain regulatory safeguards. For example, issuers of securities are exempted from issuing a full prospectus registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore in respect of offers that are made only to accredited investors, and intermediaries are exempted from a number of business conduct requirements when dealing with accredited investors. Investors should consult a professional adviser if they do not understand any consequence of being treated as an accredited investor.</p>

						<p>When we deal with you as an accredited investor, we would be exempt from complying with certain requirements under the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (the "SFA") and certain regulations and notices issued thereunder.</p>

						<p>Please note that the regulatory requirements that we are exempted from when dealing with you as an accredited investor may be amended and updated from time to time due to regulatory changes or otherwise.</p>

						<p><strong>Under the SFA and the regulations and notices issued thereunder:</strong></p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<strong>Prospectus Exemptions under Sections 275 and 305 of the SFA.</strong>
								<p>
									Under Part XIII of the SFA, all offers of securities and securities-based derivatives contracts, and units of collective investment schemes are required to be made in or accompanied by a prospectus in respect of the offer that is lodged and registered with the Monetary Authority of Singapore ("<strong>MAS</strong>") and which complies with the prescribed content requirements, unless exempted. The SFA further provides for criminal liability for false and misleading statements contained in the prospectus, omissions to state any information required to be included in the prospectus or omissions to state new circumstances that have risen since the prospectus was lodged with the MAS which would have been required to be included in the prospectus if it had arisen before the prospectus was lodged with the MAS. In addition, certain persons, including the person making the offer, the issuer, the issue manager, and the underwriter (the "<strong>Persons</strong>") may be liable to compensate any person who suffers loss or damage as a result of the false or misleading statement in or omission from the prospectus, even if such persons were not involved in the making of the false or misleading statement or the omission.
								</p>
								<p>Sections 275 and 305 of the SFA are exemptions from the prospectus registration requirement under the SFA, and exempt the offeror from registering a prospectus when the offer of securities and securities-based derivatives contracts, and units of collective investment schemes is made to relevant persons. Relevant persons include accredited investors. In addition, secondary sales made to institutional investors and relevant persons, which include accredited investors, remain exempt from the prospectus registration requirement provided that certain requirements are met.</p>

								<p><strong>Subsequent Sales:</strong> Subsequent sales of securities, securities-based derivatives contracts and collective investment schemes are subject to restrictions under Sections 276(1) and 276(2) or, as the case may be, Sections 305A(1)(b) such that subsequent sales to relevant persons (including accredited investors) will continue to be exempt from prospectus requirements.</p>

								<p>Where securities, securities-based derivatives contracts and collective investment schemes are subscribed or purchased under Section 275 or 305 of the SFA by a relevant person which is:
									<ul class="alphabet">
										<li>a corporation (which is not an accredited investor) the sole business of which is to hold investments and the entire share capital of which is owned by one or more individuals, each of whom is an accredited investor (the "
											<strong>Corporation</strong>"); or</li>
										<li>a trust (where the trustee is not an accredited investor) whose sole purpose is to hold investments and each beneficiary of the trust is an individual who is an accredited investor (the "<strong>Trust</strong>"),</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>inter alia, securities of that corporation or the beneficiaries' rights and interest (howsoever described) in that trust shall not be transferred within six months after that corporation or that trust has acquired the securities, securities-based derivatives contracts and collective investment schemes pursuant to an offer made under Section 275 or 305 of the SFA except, inter alia, to an institutional investor or to a relevant person.</p>
								<p>If you opt to be treated as an accredited investor, the above restrictions will not apply and you will not be prohibited from being a transferee of the securities of the Corporation or interests in the Trust in the circumstances specified.</p>

								<p><strong>When we deal with you as an accredited investor, the issuer and/or offeror is exempt from the prospectus requirements under Part XIII of the SFA pursuant to the exemptions under Sections 275 and 305 of the SFA. As a result of this, the issuer and/or offeror is not under any statutory obligation to ensure that all offers of the relevant products to you are made in or accompanied by a prospectus that is lodged and registered with the MAS and which complies with the prescribed content requirements. Consequently, the issuer and/or offeror is not subject to the statutory prospectus liability under the SFA and you would not be able to seek compensation from the Persons under the civil liability regime for prospectuses even if you suffer loss or damage as a result of any false or misleading statement in or omissions in the offering document. Subsequent sales of securities, securities-based derivative contracts and collective investment schemes first sold under inter alia Section 275 and 305 can also be made to you, as well as transfers of securities of Corporations and interests in Trusts. You are therefore not protected by the prospectus registration requirements of the SFA.</strong></p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Restrictions on Advertisements under Sections 251 and 300 of the SFA.</strong>
								<p>Sections 251 and 300 of the SFA prohibit any advertisement or publication referring to an offer or intended offer of securities and securities-based derivatives contracts, and units of collective investment schemes from being made, except in certain circumstances. In this regard, where a preliminary document has been lodged with the MAS, certain communications may be made. These include the dissemination of, and presentation of oral or written material on matters contained in, the preliminary document which has been lodged with the MAS to institutional investors and relevant persons under Sections 251(3), 251(4)(a), 300(2A) and 300(2B)(a) of the SFA. Relevant persons include accredited investors.</p>
								<p><strong>When we deal with you as an accredited investor, you may receive communications relating to a preliminary document which has been lodged with the MAS. You are therefore not protected by the requirements of Sections 251 and 300 of the SFA.</strong></p>
							</li>

								<p><strong>When we deal with you as an accredited investor, we are exempt from treating you as a "retail customer" in relation to certain requirements stipulated under Part III of the SFR pertaining to the treatment of a retail customer's moneys and assets. You are therefore not protected by those requirements under Part III of the SFR.</strong></p>

							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Regulation 40 of the SFR.</strong>
								<p>.Regulation 40(1) of the SFR provides that a CMSL is required to furnish to each customer on a monthly basis a statement of account containing certain particulars prescribed under Regulation 40(2) of the SFR. In addition, Regulation 40(3) of the SFR provides that a CMSL is required to furnish to each customer, at the end of every quarter of a calendar year, a statement of account containing, where applicable, the assets, derivatives contracts of the customer and spot foreign exchange contracts for the purposes of leveraged foreign exchange trading of the customer that are outstanding and have not been liquidated and cash balances (if any) of the customer at the end of that quarter.</p>
								<p><strong>When we deal with you as an accredited investor and provided we have made available to you (on a real-time basis) the prescribed particulars in the form of electronic records stored on an electronic facility and you have consented to those particulars being made available in this manner or you have requested in writing not to receive the statement of account, we are not under any statutory obligation to furnish a monthly or quarterly statement of account to you. You are therefore not protected by the requirements of Regulations 40(1) and (3) of the SFR.</strong></p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Regulation 45 of the SFR.</strong>
								<p>Regulation 45 of the SFR provides that borrowing and lending of specified products by a CMSL (i) must be recorded in a prior written agreement between the CMSL and the lender or borrower or their duly authorised agent where such agreement includes certain prescribed details; and (ii) must be collateralised. In particular, the CMSL is required to ensure that the collateral provided must, throughout the period that the specified products are borrowed or lent, have a value of not less than 100% of the market value of the specified products borrowed or lent. Regulation 45 of the SFR further sets out the acceptable forms of collateral for these purposes.</p>
								<p><strong>When we deal with you as an accredited investor, we are not under any statutory obligation to provide collateral to you under Regulation 45 of the SFR when we borrow specified products from you. You are therefore not protected by the collateral requirements under Regulation 45 of the SFR when you lend specified products to us. Where we provide assets to you as collateral for the borrowing, the written agreement for shall specify whether the specified products borrowed and the assets provided comprising specified products (if any) are marked to market and if so, the procedures for calculating the margin. However (unlike for retail customer), the agreement does not have to include the requirement to mark-to-market on every business day the specified products that are borrowed or lent nor the minimum collateral comprising specified products and the procedures for calculating the margins.</strong> </p>
							</li>

							<li>
								<strong>Regulation 47DA of the SFR.</strong>
								<p> Regulation 47DA (1) and (2) of the SFR provide for certain general risk disclosure requirements that a CMSL dealing in specified capital markets products must comply with. For this purpose, "specified capital markets products" means capital markets products other than futures contracts, spot foreign exchange contracts for the purposes of leveraged foreign exchange trading and foreign exchange over-the-counter derivatives contracts. In particular, the CMSL must not open a trading account for a customer for the purpose of entering into transactions of sale and purchase of any specified capital markets products unless it has furnished the customer with a written risk disclosure document disclosing the material risks of the specified capital markets products, and receives an acknowledgement signed and dated by the customer that he has received and understood the nature and contents of the risk disclosure document. Further, the CMSL must not enter any transaction of sale or purchase of any specified capital markets products unless it has informed the customer whether it is acting in that transaction as a principal or agent and/or its intention to do so.</p>
								<p><strong>When we deal with you as an accredited investor, we are not under any statutory obligation to provide you with the risk disclosures, and the capacity in which we act, in the manner contemplated under Regulation 47DA of the SFR. You are therefore not protected by the requirements under Regulation 47DA of the SFR.</strong></p>
