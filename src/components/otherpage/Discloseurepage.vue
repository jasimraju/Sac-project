                        <h3>Risk Disclosure Statement For Trading In Securities And Equity-linked Instruments</h3>
                        <p>This Risk Disclosure Statement shall apply where you trade in securities and equity-linked
                            products through or in connection with any platforms owned, provided or made available by
                            SAC Capital Private Limited (“SAC Capital”), including any services, features,
                            functionalities, materials or content provided or made available by SAC Capital on such
                            platforms.</p>

                        <p>The objective of this statement is to explain to you the nature of trading in securities and
                            equity-linked products prior to your undertaking of such transactions in securities and
                            equity-linked products. This statement may not be sufficient to explain all the risks of
                            trading in securities and equity-linked products. You should therefore fully understand the
                            nature of the transactions, how they actually work, the extent of their exposure to risks
                            and the potential losses that could be incurred.<strong> You should carefully consider
                                whether trading in securities and equity-linked products is suitable for you in the
                                light of your financial resources, experience, objectives for engaging in the
                                transactions, ability to bear risks and other relevant circumstances. You should fully
                                understand and be aware that except where we are obliged either contractually or under
                                the provisions of relevant regulations to pro-actively provide you with suitability
                                advice (which is not generally the case), it is your sole responsibility to make your
                                own independent appraisal and investigation into the risks associated with the desired
                                transaction or product. You should, therefore, consult with your own legal, Tax,
                                financial and other relevant professional advisers prior to entering into any particular
                                transaction.</strong> You must also ensure that you have sufficient knowledge,
                            experience, sophistication and professional advice to make your own evaluation of the merits
                            and risks of entering into such transactions. </p>

                                <strong>TRADING IN SECURITIES</strong>
                                <p>In considering whether to trade in securities or enter into any such transaction, you
                                    should be aware of the following:</p>
                                <ul class="alphabet">
                                    <li>Trading in securities can be extremely risky. You should be prepared to lose all
                                        of the funds used for trading in securities. You should not fund your securities
                                        trading activities with retirement savings, emergency funds or funds set aside
                                        for purposes such as education or home ownership.</li>
                                    <li>You should be cautious of claims of large profits from trading in securities.
                                        You need to be wary of advertisements or other statements that emphasise the
                                        potential for large profits in trading in securities. Trading in securities can
                                        also lead to large and immediate financial losses.</li>
                                    <li>Trading in securities requires knowledge of the securities markets. Trading in
                                        securities require in-depth knowledge of the securities markets and trading
                                        techniques and strategies. In attempting to profit through trading in
                                        securities, you must compete with professional, licensed traders employed by
                                        securities companies. You should have the appropriate experience before engaging
                                        in the trading of securities.</li>
                                    <li>Trading in securities requires knowledge of a company’s operations. You should
                                        be familiar with a securities company’s business practices, including the
                                        operation of the company’s order execution systems, procedures, and should
                                        confirm that a company has adequate systems capacity to permit you to engage in
                                        securities trading activities.</li>
                                    <li>Trading in securities may result in large commissions. Trading in securities may
                                        require you to trade your accounts aggressively, and pay commissions on each
                                        trade. The total daily commissions that you pay on trades may add to losses or
                                        significantly reduce earnings.</li>
                                    <li>Trading in securities normally requires the use of specialized software. You
                                        must be knowledgeable in the use of this software. Otherwise, you may not be
                                        able to correctly interpret your security positions, trades may be entered or
                                        routed incorrectly, positions may not be correctly closed out, and you could be
                                        at a competitive disadvantage to more skilled traders. </li>
                                    <li>Disruptions in the electronic trading systems or failure, interruption or down
                                        time of the computer hardware, communication lines, and data networks could
                                        disrupt trading and the liquidity and availability of timely execution or
                                        reporting could diminish substantially. This could result in substantial losses,
                                        especially during periods of volatility. </li>
                                    <li>Securities can be very volatile and can open at dramatically different prices on
                                        the opening of each day. Similarly, regulatory authorities can halt trading in a
                                        security or securities and prices can vary dramatically at the reopening with no
                                        interim capability of trading during the halt. Holding large positions in
                                        volatile securities, especially after the end of the trading day, can result in
                                        tremendous losses. </li>
                                    <li>Market and specific security volatility adds to the risk on online trading. High
                                        volumes of trading at the market opening or intra-day may cause delays in
                                        execution and executions at prices significantly away from the market price
                                        quoted or displayed at the time the order was entered. Market makers may execute
                                        orders manually or reduce their size guarantees during periods of volatility
                                        resulting in possible delays in order execution and losses. Program trading,
                                        institutional buying/selling, mutual fund buying/selling, and news related
                                        events also add to the volatility of the overall market and specific securities.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Companies are required to execute a market order fully and promptly without
                                        regard to price and that, while you may receive a prompt execution of a market
                                        order, the execution may be at a price significantly different from the current
                                        quoted price of that security. Limit orders will be executed only at a specified
                                        price or better than that, while you receive price protection, there is the
                                        possibility that the order will not be executed. Since market orders must be
                                        executed as promptly as possible, it may not be feasible to cancel a market
                                        order since it may have already been executed, even if a customer has not yet
                                        received a report confirming the execution. Entering a cancel order and separate
                                        replacement order may result in you being responsible for the execution of
                                        duplicate orders.</li>
                                    <li>You may suffer market losses during periods of volatility in the price and
                                        volume of a particular stock when system problems result in inability to place
                                        buy or sell orders. If you trade online, you may experience difficulties
                                        accessing your accounts due to high Internet traffic or because of system’s
                                        capacity limitations. When online trading has been disabled or is not available
                                        because of system limitations, you may have difficulty reaching our
                                        representatives on the telephone during periods of high volume.</li>
                                    <li>If you have filled out a trading authorisation and designated someone other than
                                        yourself to trade your capital, you should be aware this opens up new risks.
                                        Your authorised trader will have discretion to trade any securities he/she deems
                                        appropriate, and he/she will have no legal responsibility to report the trades
                                        or executions to you. You may not be able to monitor your capital at times on a
                                        real time basis. If your authorised trader is unreliable or unsuccessful, you
                                        could lose all of your capital.</li>
                                    <li>Security is a key requirement for your protection. You must protect your user
                                        identification and password. You must also protect against computer entry by
                                        someone other than yourself. You are responsible for all trades entered under
                                        your user identification and password.</li>
                                    <li>It is very important that you reconcile your account on a daily basis. Your
                                        review should include confirmations and monthly statements. You must always know
                                        your buying power and positions held in your account. Any suspected errors
                                        should immediately be brought to the attention of SAC Capital. All losses are
                                        your responsibility. The sole responsibility of SAC Capital shall be limited to
                                        loss of funds caused solely by the fraudulent or dishonest acts of its
                                        employees. </li>

                                <strong>TRADING IN EQUITY-LINKED INSTRUMENTS</strong>
                                <p>The return component of equity-linked instruments is based on the performance of a
                                    single security, a basket of securities, or an equity index. You may suffer capital
                                    loss should the price of the underlying shares go against you. In extreme cases, you
                                    may lose your entire capital. The maximum return on investment is usually limited to
                                    a predetermined amount of cash as specified in the equity-linked instruments. So
                                    even if your view of the direction of the underlying stock price is correct, you
                                    will not gain more than the specified amount. The return payable for the
                                    equity-linked instruments is determined at a specified time on the valuation date,
                                    irrespective of the fluctuations in the underlying stock price before or after the
                                    specified time. Unlike traditional time deposits, there is no guarantee that you
                                    will get a return on your investment or any yield. There is also a possibility that
                                    the note issuers will default on their obligation in returning you the purchase
                                    principal or in selling you the underlying securities. When you buy equity-linked
                                    instruments for higher returns, you must be prepared to take higher risks.</p>

                                <strong>TRADING IN FOREIGN SECURITIES</strong>
                                <p>You should only invest in foreign securities if you understand your exposure to risk.
                                    You should not rely on this information as a complete explanation of the risks of
                                    investing in foreign securities.<strong>You should ask your company for copies of
                                        risk disclosure statements issued by foreign brokerage companies that it trades
                                        with on your behalf for a full understanding of the risks involved in trading
                                        securities in that foreign country.</strong></p>

                                <p>In considering whether to trade in foreign securities or enter into any such
                                    transaction, you should be aware of the following:</p>

                                <ul class="alphabet">
                                    <li>All orders to buy and sell securities are made in the relevant foreign currency
                                        but the settlement amount may, at your request, be converted and paid in
                                        Singapore dollars. The currency conversion will occur after the trade has
                                        occurred. You carry the risk that the foreign exchange rate may have changed
                                        since your order was entered. The volatility of the exchange rate is a matter
                                        you should consider. The past performance of the exchange rate is not
                                        necessarily a guide to future performance. Depending on the circumstances and
                                        timing of the transaction, and relevant movements in currencies during that
                                        period, the difference between what you originally expected to pay or receive
                                        and what you actually pay or receive may be substantial. In extreme cases,
                                        currency volatility may significantly erode potential profits (or significantly
                                        increase any losses) you make from buying or selling the relevant foreign
                                        securities.</li>
                                    <li>While you hold foreign securities, you are exposed to the risks of currency
                                        movements. Changes in the relevant foreign exchange rate may adversely affect
                                        the value of your investment and the investment return. Understanding how the
                                        exchange rate impacts your investment is important. The direction of the
                                        Singapore dollar will influence the value of your foreign investments. Ignoring
                                        market price movements, if the value of the Singapore dollar falls relative to
                                        the currency in which securities are denominated, then the value of your foreign
                                        securities will rise in Singapore dollar terms. Conversely, if the value of the
                                        Singapore dollar rises, then the value of your foreign securities will fall.
                                        Similarly, movements in the relevant exchange rate will impact on the Singapore
                                        dollar value of any dividends or distributions you receive.</li>

                                    <li>You may suffer liquidity risk in that you will not be able to dispose of your
                                        foreign securities for a reasonable price in the market. Like all markets, this
                                        may be because there are insufficient buyers for the foreign securities, or the
                                        price buyers are prepared to pay is lower than sellers are prepared to accept.
                                        Overseas markets may have lower trading volumes and fewer listed companies. The
                                        trading times for each day may be different to the Singapore market. Factors
                                        such as these may affect the liquidity of trading in the foreign securities.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Some foreign markets are much more volatile than the Singapore market, and this
                                        can have adverse consequences for orders designated “at market”. To limit this
                                        risk you should always consider putting a “limit price” on your orders.
                                        Volatility can be particularly high in markets that continue to operate outside
                                        normal trading hours in other countries.</li>

                                    <li>The market price of foreign securities is affected by the same risks that affect
                                        all stock market investments. These include the present and anticipated economic
                                        environment, investor sentiment, interest rates, exchange rates and the general
                                        level of economic activity. However, it may be difficult to fully understand all
                                        of the political, economic and social factors that influence the relevant
                                        overseas market. While these factors provide benefits of diversification, they
                                        also contribute to the risk of investing overseas.</li>
                                    <li>Collateral you provide and which are held overseas may not have the same
                                        segregation or trust protection for you and may in any event be delayed in
                                        recovering should a relevant overseas correspondent broker used by SAC Capital
                                        be the subject of insolvency proceedings in that jurisdiction.</li>
                                    <li>(g) Where your securities and/or money are held in a foreign jurisdiction, they
                                        may be subject to the risks of exchange control restrictions being imposed.</li>

                                            <li>Investment in OTC Securities involves substantial risks including market
                                                risk, liquidity risk, and the risk that the relevant issuers and/or the
                                                guarantors will be unable to satisfy its/their obligations under the OTC
                                                Securities. Investors should therefore ensure that they understand the
                                                nature of all these risks before making a decision to invest in any of
                                                the OTC Securities. You should consider carefully whether each OTC

                                            <li>OTC Securities constitute general unsecured contractual obligations of
                                                the issuers and/or the guarantors and of no other person. SAC Capital is
                                                not responsible for, nor does it guarantee the due performance of the
                                                obligations of the issuers under the OTC Securities. In particular, it
                                                should be noted that the issuers of OTC Securities may issue a large
                                                number of financial instruments on a global basis and, at any given
                                                time, the financial instruments outstanding may be substantial. If you
                                                purchase any particular OTC Securities, you are relying upon the

                                                may cause adverse movements in the value and price of the underlying

                                                be subject to considerable fluctuations in value. The price of the OTC
                                                Securities may fall in value as rapidly as it may rise due to, including

                                                interest rate, the time remaining to expiry and the creditworthiness of

                                                necessarily in the same magnitude and direction; therefore, prospective

                                    <li>In relation to Equity-Linked Notes, the following apply in addition to the
                                        above:
                                        <ol class="roman">
                                            <li>Equity-linked notes <strong>(“ELNs”)</strong> may be considered as
                                                combining a debt instrument with an option that allows a bull (rising),
                                                bear (falling) or range view. Although industry practice is for the
                                                price of ELNs to be quoted in yield terms similar to treasury bills,
                                                they carry a higher degree of risk because ELNs are investments with an
                                                embedded option, usually in respect of the shares of a single underlying
                                                entity. ELNs are typically sold at a discount to par value and the
                                                discount represents the equity option premium. The return on an ELN is
                                                usually determined by the performance of a single security, a basket of
                                                securities or an index. Whenever you buy an ELN, you will,
                                                correspondingly, be selling (writing) an option on chosen securities.
                                            </li>
                                            <li>A bull ELN combines a debt instrument with the premium received from
                                                writing a put option on the chosen securities. If the value of these
                                                securities falls to a level less than the strike price minus the premium
                                                received, the buyer will suffer a loss. The maximum potential loss could
                                                be the entire capital sum. Although the bull ELN offers a higher yield
                                                than traditional notes, it is only suitable for investors who are
                                                prepared to accept the risk of receiving the underlying securities if
                                                the value of the OTC Securities falls below the strike price at
                                                maturity.</li>
                                            <li>A bear ELN combines a debt instrument with the premium received by
                                                selling a call option on the chosen securities. Upon maturity, the
                                                amount that the issuer of a bear ELN will repay the investor depends on
                                                the strike price and the market value of the OTC Securities at maturity.
                                                Buyers of a bear ELN must be prepared for the risk of losing the entire
                                                capital invested, in the event that the market value of the OTC
                                                Securities is above the strike price.</li>
                                            <li>A range ELN combines a debt instrument with the premium received by
                                                selling both a put option and a call option on the chosen securities.
                                                The risk of this product is that while the upside returns is limited,
                                                the investor stands to lose the entire capital invested. Losses will be
                                                realised if the market value of the OTC Securities exceeds the call
                                                strike price or the investor will receive the underlying securities if
                                                the market value of the OTC Securities falls below the put strike price
                                                at maturity.</li>
                                            <li>You should also note that the return on investment of an ELN is
                                                pre-determined, so that even if your view of the direction of the
                                                underlying market is correct, you will not gain more than the specified
                                                amount. The return payable for an ELN is determined at a specific time
                                                on the valuation date, irrespective of the fluctuations in the
                                                underlying securities prices before or after that specific time. You
                                                should also note that unlike a traditional note, there is no guarantee
                                                that you will receive the principal amount invested or that you will
                                                derive any return on its investment or yield from an ELN. In addition,
                                                there is a limited secondary market for outstanding ELN issues.</li>
