                                        use commercially reasonable methods to notify you of such revisions, such as by

                                    <p>We will cease to retain your personal data, or remove the means by which the data
                                        can be associated with you, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that such
                                        retention no longer serves the purpose for which the personal data was
                                        collected, and such retention is no longer necessary for legal or business
                                        purposes.</p>
